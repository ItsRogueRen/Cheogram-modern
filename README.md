# Cheogram Android

This is a fork of [Conversations](https://conversations.im) to implement features of use to the [Sopranica](https://soprani.ca) project.

The Cheogram Android app allows you to join a worldwide communication network.  It especially focuses on features useful to users who want to contact those on other networks as well, such as SMS-enabled phone numbers.

Based on the app Conversations, but with unique features:

* Messages with both media and text, including animated media
* Unobtrusive display of subject lines, where present
* Links to known contacts are shown with their name
* Integrates with gateways' add contact flows
* When using a gateway to the phone network, integrate with the native Android Phone app
* Address book integration
